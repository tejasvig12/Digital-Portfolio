	<h3 class="hi">Welcome! To start it off, let's learn some facts about myself! I am currently enrolled in CS-II, and although I was sort of pushed into it, I have started to slowly like it over time and have even made some of my own projects outside of this class, such as a personality quiz, a cybersecurity app, and a prototype for an e-library! I am also on the Allen Varsity Tennis Team and have been since a freshman. I also play competitive tennis outside of school and I hope to continue doing that by playing college tennis. </h3>

	<h3 class="hi">I am very interested in fine arts such as digital art, painting, and graphic design. I am also currently in Animation II, and we are working on a short film right now! The college I want to go to the most is Savannah College of Art and Design(SCAD), which is located in Savannah, Georgia. If you couldn't tell already, animation is what I want to major in and have a minor in computer science.</h3>

	<h3 class="hi">I have been studying computer science for the past 3 years inside and outside of school and through it, I have met so many new people and learned so much that I never knew before and I am excited to keep that journey going!</h3>
