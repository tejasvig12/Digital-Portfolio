	    <p>I considered this proposal mostly because of the fact that it is my friend's, and because it is a very convenient idea, because what it does is filter deals and good clothes for people who don't have the time in doing so. However, I didn't pick this because of the amount of work that would go into it. For example, you would have to input millions of outfits and have different categories for each one. You would also have to categorize it by websites such as Amazon, Shein, Macy's, and more, and I just don't think I can commit that much time to this project. I also think that is is very unrealistic since there are many extensions and websites out there that already do this, such as Honey.</p>

	    </h3>
	    <p> I think this proposal is good because of how it saves time when buying food since you do it all digitally, and it is perfect for our highschool especially because of the long lines that last until the end of lunch, which causes you to not even eat your food sometimes. However, I rejected this proposal because there are also a lot of students with no phones, which makes it hard for them to order because if buying food physically is completely eliminated, then they will not be able to eat lunch.</p>

	    <p>I considered this proposal because it is a good idea for people who are uncreative in cooking and have no cooking skills at all. However, I immediately let go of this idea because I always know what I want to cook, and when I don't, I will just order out instead of thinking of what to cook. Also, I personally have never met anyone with this problem so this doesn't relate to me at all.</p>

	    </h3>
	    <p>This is a good proposal because it can combine many different variations of instruments to give a drummer exactly what they want. However, this product is made for only a niche group of people and I myself am not a drummer, so I find it hard to relate to. Also, I have seen this on Garage Band already, where you could customize the drum set and use a variety of different instruments, but then again, I might be wrong because I am not a musician.</p>

	    </h3>
	    <p>I considered this proposal because it is a great idea for people who spend thousands of dollars on stocks every month yet still lose money. However, I rejected this idea immediately because first of all, I am not interested in stocks and second of all, it sounds extremely complicated to do and I simply don't have the funds to make this project a reality. However, I believe other people can do it and I still think it is a good idea.</p>

	    </h3>
	    <p>This proposal is good because it is a problem that everyone faces in their daily life, which is not knowing which outfit to wear to any event. According to the proposal, it will also base it off body types and skin color so it can choose what color will suit you best. Ultimately, I had to shoot this down because I found a project that I was more interested in and this also seems very time-consuming and demands expenses which I don't like.</p>

	    </h3>
	    <p>I considered this proposal because I have trouble planning trips because of all of the specific things you need to plan beforehand, such as the hotel, where to eat, the tickets for attractions, and more. However, I rejected this idea because I have seen many other websites online with the same purpose and probably much more efficient. But if this project is a success, then I will definitely start using it for future trips.</p>

	    <p>I really liked this proposal because it proposes a fun game filled with weird concepts and a multiplayer gameplay which is exactly what I like, and I am really excited to see where the developers working on this go with this project. However, I had to ultimately reject it because I have a personal vendetta against any games on Roblox, which is where this will be published on, and I hate Roblox with a passion so it goes against my morals to work on this. But if this wasn't on Roblox and I didn't have my own ISP idea, I would definitely want to work with this team.</p>
