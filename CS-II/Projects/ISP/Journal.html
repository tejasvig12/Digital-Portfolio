      <a href="../Business Plan/index.html">Back to ISP Proposal</a>
      <p><b>17 April 2023</b></p>
      <p>Personal Plans: My plans for this week for the ISP are to get the Cold,Flu, and Allergies page fully working with proper Javascript. I want the results to be as accurate as possible, by using if conditions and for loops. I'm not sure where to start with this so I will ask my dad for advice. This will greatly further the state of our project because cold,flu, and allergies are some of the most common illnesses in the world, and creating an accurate quiz for that first will make our project much more appealing for people to test run and actually put their trust into.
	<p><a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-SymptomsQuiz/issues/34">In this issue, I will be adding more symptoms to the cold, flu, and allergies page so the user's results will be much more descriptive and accurate.</a></p>

      <p>Technical Challenges: A technical challenge that I had this week was my stylesheet not working with the button that I added in index.html to go to cfa.html. To fix that, I asked one of my classmates who seats 2 seats away from me and he told me that I just had a couple of typos and some syntax errors which he helped me fix. Another challenge I had this week and still have is that I don't know how to make the results of the quiz very accurate. I will solve that by asking my dad to help me on it because he is skilled in Javascript.</p>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges: There was one scheduling challenge on this Thursday because I was gone for a doctors appointment, and when I came back, I was extremely tired and was getting a bad headache, which means I couldnt do any work on that day.</p>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: There were barely any interpersonal challenges for this week, except for the fact that one of my teammates still hasn't done his missions for CS yet meaning that he doesn't have time to work on the ISP, which is concerning due to the fact that it's due in 2 weeks.<p>

      <p>Technical Challenges: A technical challenge that I had this week was when I made another button for a symptom, I didn't know how to link it to the updateResult function because I don't know how to code that. To fix that, I will ask my dad to help me this week with figuring that out because he's really good at javascript.</p>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges: We didn't have any problems with our scheduling this week, everything ran smoothly.</p>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: A challenge we had was that one of our teammates wasn't doing any work, partly because they don't know how to code in Javascript, but I told them to do the module on Project STEM and I don't know if they've done it. So I will talk to them about it after the 4-day weekend and make sure they know what they're doing.</p>

      <p>Technical Challenges: One challenge that we had (not me) was that one of my teammates couldn't log in to their Tabby, which was problematic because there was a lot of work to be done. To solve it, they went to Mr.Ben and fixed it.</p>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges: There were no scheduling challenges this week, everything went smoothly and we were all satisfied with our project so far.</p>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: A challenge I had this week was that I had a lot of family problems and I was depressed the whole week because of that, so I couldn't focus on my project. I will do better the next week.</p>

<p>Technical Challenges: A technical challenge I had this week was that we didn't know where to start with the Symptoms Quiz. So what I did was have Shreya and Melanie make a flowchart detailing all the choices that the user could make, leading to an accurate result. Using that flowchart, we will code the buttons and the appropriate results in the coming month, now that we have a plan that we can follow.</p>
<p>Scheduling Challenges: There were no scheduling challenges this week, everything went well, and we all communicated well.</p>
<p>Interpersonal Challenges: An interpersonal challenge was when me and my teammate were arguing because he wasn't doing any work. It got so bad that I almost kicked him out, but we apologized to each other and we are both doing our work properly.</p>

      <p><b> 13 March 2023</b></p>
<p>Technical Challenges: A technical challenge that I had this week was getting the show result button to work on every device, and I fixed that by pushing the code that I wrote to GitHub because that was the main error. I learned this week that to fix my errors I just needed to be patient and look for the simpler things. </p>
<p>Scheduling Challenge: A scheduling challenge that I had was that I was gone for 2 days for my animation trip, and since I was the project manager, it affected my team a lot. To fix this, I coded most of the website when I was gone.</p>
<p>Interpersonal Challenges: For this week, there were no interpersonal challenges, we all communicated well and also finished a lot of issues.</p>

      <p>Technical Challenges: A technical challenge that we had this week was not getting our output from  VS Code to show up when we present, which was a pretty big problem. I assigned this task to my other teammates,  but none of them were able to finish it in time because no one knew how to do it. This problem is still not resolved but we will get it done by next week.</p>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges: A scheduling challenge that was there was when I went to UT Austin for UIL, and I was gone for 2 days so I couldn't work on our project. I texted my teammates and resolved any issues they had from where I was. </p>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: There were no interpersonal challenges this week because of the fact that I was not there for almost the whole week and only came back on Friday (today). All in all, this week went smoothly and our project is working properly.</p>
      <p><b>13 Feb 2023</b></p>
      <p>Technical Challenges: One main technical challenge that I had was getting the "showResult" button to work. I checked my code three times but I didn't see an error. To solve this, I asked my dad to help me and after he looked over my code, he said I was just missing a bracket. My dad also showed me an easier way to enable the onClick function, which I then wrote in my code and now the button works properly.
      <p>Scheduling Challenges: A scheduling challenge that I had was that one of my teammates was absent for a while and when they came back, they refused to do any work so I told them if they didn't work, I would kick them off the team, so they agreed to do the work.</p>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: I didn't have many interpersonal challenges this week, because mostly everything was running smoothly this week.</p>
      <p><b>6 Feb 2023</b></p>
      <p>Technical Challenges: A technical challenge I had this week was creating the radio buttons for the answer choices, and I solved that by watching a tutorial on Youtube and using that to help me write my code.</p>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges: A challenge that I had was that one of my teammates wasn't there at school this week, so I had to communicate to them through text, and they never check their messages so that made it hard for me. I solved this when they came back later.</p>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: An interpersonal challenge was that one of my teammates kept insisting to use w3Schools to see our output because they couldn't see it on their end. I kept telling them to check it from VS Code but they didn't know how to clone the repository so I also had to explain that to them. I think that there's some learning they need to do, but other that that, everything was fine.</p>
      <p><b>30 Jan 2023</b></p>
      <p>Technical Challenges: There were many because it was a snow week, and I also couldn't use my laptop this whole week because I wasn't allowed to.</p>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges: Challenges that we had were that since it was a snow week, we didn't do anything productive this week. However, we got our presentation done for our ISP Proposal, which was mostly done by our release engineer.</p>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: There were none because everything went smoothly this week, except for the fact that we got a whole week off of school.</p>
								
      <p><b>23 Jan 2023</b></p>
      <p>Technical Challenges: Some challenges we had were configuring our github user with VS Code, but I figured it out by using Stack Overflow and helped the rest of my teammates.</p>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges: We had some challenges with communicating with one of our team members that was in a different period,but I assigned him some tasks and they got to work on them.</p>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: I called one of my teammates an idiot because they wouldn't understand why we had to add a simple concept to our project, and I apologized but I really think my teammate needs to figure out what is really important in our project because they are Product Manager after all, and not realizing a simple thing that needs to go into our project for it to work means that they are definitely not fit for that role. Another challenge was that some of my teammates asked if we could do something fun in our website and I said yes initially, but later I realized that we need to keep our website professional; after all, it is a medical diagnosis that people want, so I will turn them down later.</p>
      <p><b>16 Jan 2023</b></p>
      <p>Technical Challenges: Our main challenge was that we needed to figure out where we would write our code on, and we solved this by finally deciding on Visual Studio Code to write on.</p>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges: We didn't have any scheduling challenges this week, so everything was fine.</p>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: There were no interpersonal challenges this week.</p>

      <p><b>9 Jan 2023</b></p>
      <p>Technical Challenges: Our main challenge is that we still haven't figured out where to base our code on and where we can see a successful output. We will solve that by assigning that task to our release engineer, and we will get it done by next week Tuesday. Another challenge that we had was deciding which coding languages to use, and at the end we decided on mainly Java and a little bit of Swift for the people that do not know Java.</p>
      <p>Scheduling Challenges: A scheduling challenge that my team faced this week was that one of our team members isn't in our period so I had to text them personally. They also couldn't send messages in the group chat for some reason so I messaged them personally and told them what to do.</p>
      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: One interpersonal challenge I had was that one of my teammates cannot text in messages and that person always has to communicate through me which I know must be a hassle for them. To solve that, I will make another groupchat on a different app such as Instagram or Discord so we can all communicate properly and there will be no misunderstandings.</p>

      <p>(Software)Development Engineer: This is a programmer or a coder, and it's a person who designs computer programs to solve real-world probelems. I am very suitable to this role because I already know what algorithm to implement for my product to work. I am also a pretty good programmer. I except to encounter challenges like what language I should use because I am still unsure between Javascript and Swift. I will overcome that by researching a bit more and seeing what is best suited to my project.</p>
      <p>QA Engineer: This person monitors every phase of the software development and checks for bugs. They also identify issues before a product launch, and run several tests before it.

They are also responsible for the budget and the success or failure of the product. I would be suited to this role well because I was the one who came up with this idea. Some problems that I might run into are that I am not good at leading people, but I will overcome that.</p>
      <p>Product Manager: This person identifies the customer need and the objectives that their product will fill when it's released. They are also in charge of lauching the product. I am not suited for this because I am not good at seeing what the audience wants.<p>
      <p>Release Engineer: This person is responsible for deciding where the product's software will be hosted on. They are the ones deciding how the testing,packaging, and deployment is conducted.</p>
