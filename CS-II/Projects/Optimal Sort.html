	<p>Graph Explanation: According to the times of all of the sorts, the bubble sort was the fastest because of how efficient the algorithm is. However, when it came to running 100,000 words, it was almost 6 minutes to 7 minutes for each sort because of the sheer amount of data that it had to run. But in sorting the 100,000 words, Insertion sort was the fastest by just a couple of milliseconds because it had the least CPU core exceeded instances, which was not the same for Selection Sort and Bubble Sort. The slowest one that I noticed was Selection Sort because it had the most amount of CPU core exceeded circumstances which was probably because of how slow the code ran. All in all, the fastest sorting algorithm overall was bubble sort because the low number of swaps leads to a lower runtime for this, but it's time is folllowed closely by Insertion Sort.</p>
