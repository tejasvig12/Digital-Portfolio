	<div class="essay">Ever wondered what it would be like if robots lived in our society as citizens in our world? And even better, they had real, lifelike emotions that us humans have? Those type of robots are called sentient AI. That means that the robot can think, perceive, and feel just like how a human does on a daily basis, but the difference between sentient and non-sentient is that these feelings are not pre-programmed by someone else, instead of faking the emotions they can actually feel them. Sentient AI will lead to a utopia for everyone because they can help us do everyday tasks and they have superhuman abilities.  </div>
	<div class="essay">The first reason why sentient AI is good for humans is because it reduces human error. This term talks about the common errors that a human makes, but a computer could never make that type of mistake because it is not in its code. As said by towardsdatascience, a computer's decisions are made by using the data from the previous choices and using that to reduce errors and to reach a higher accuracy (Kumar, 2019). This is definitely something that a human brain couldn't do because of the many limitations that we have.</p>
	<div class="essay">The second reason on why sentient AI is beneficial for us is because it is available 24/7. For example, us humans can only work for 6-8 hours a day at a time, and that's including breaks. But if we program AI, they would do it for us every minute and we wouldn't even need to worry about them making errors because they aren't human. Another example was when the Chernobyl power plant exploded and since humans couldn't go there themselves because of the high risk of radiation, if there were robots powered by AI at that time, we could have learned more about what caused that explostion and why (Kumar, 2019). <p>
	  <div class="essay">The third and final reason on why AI Sentience is beneficial to humanity is because they can make faster decisions than us humans. For example, if you play any online game against an AI and put it in hard mode, it will be nearly impossible to beat because its decisions are already preloaded and the CPU is much, much faster than us. When humans work on a solution, we will look at it in an emotional and a practical way but when a computer or an AI is analyzing it, it will only look at what it was programmed for and make a choice immediately.</p>
	<div class="essay">In conclusion, AI Sentience will help our world for the better because it can reduce human error, it is available at any time of the day, and because it can make immensely faster decisions than humans. So the next time you ask your Alexa or Siri the weather, remember that at a later point in time they could be saving lives too.</p>
