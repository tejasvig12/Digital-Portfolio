	<div class="essay">What exactly is a bias? It is when you have a particular prejudice against someone compared to another person, which in most situations is considered unfair((Merriam-Webster). Some biases that I have are thinking that no one will do their work, and that they will take credit for work that they didn't do(Asana). Another 3 biases would be that one of my teammates doesn't like the rest of the team because of some specific reasons, and that my teammates have no experience with the work I will ask them to do. The last bias that I will talk about overcoming is actually towards myself, which is that I don't think that I have what it takes to lead an entire team and create a successful project.</div>
	<div class="essay">The first bias I will be talking about is my gut feeling of no one doing their work. For example, if I told someone to do the research for the project and told them to be done by the end of winter break, and they still didn't do it, that would confirm my bias because then I would have to kick them off of the team. I intend to overcome this bias by making sure that I have strict deadlines for everyone, and trying my best to answer everyone's questions so no one gets unmotivated. Another thing that I will do is that if a person is not doing their work even after repeated warnings and extensions of deadlines, I will remove them from the team, with no exceptions.</div>
	<div class="essay">The second bias I want to overcome is that thinking that my teammates will take credit for work they didn't do. I have this bias because I have had a lot of experience with this in my past school years. I would do the entire group project because no one else was willing to contribute and yet they would still take credit. To solve this problem, I will make sure that everyone commits their own changes to the GitHub repository. That way, I could see what contributions everyone has done so I could see how much credit I had to give to each team member. This is foolproof because Github shows you that specific person's committed changes.</div>
	<div class="essay">The third bias I am talking about is that one of my teammates does not like 2 of the other team members. I won't name them for anonymity, but they came up to me and told me. This would become a big problem if not resolved quickly because miscommunication and not liking your team members leads to arguments and eventual refusal to work together, which leads to a failed ISP. To fix this, I will have the said team members meet up and have a conversation about their reasons for why they are prejudiced towards each other. After that, if the issues are still not resolved, then I will take it to Mr.Ben-Yaakov or entirely take them off the team.</div>
	<div class="essay">The fourth bias which I am working towards overcoming is that my team members might not have any experience in the work that I will assign them. For example, this project will consist heavily of Javascript, JSON, HTML, and CSS. We have already learnt the last two as a class, but I am not sure that the rest of my team knows how to code in Javascript, which is the main language that we'll be using. To solve this problem, I will ask all of my team members if they know how to code in Java. If they don't, then I will have them start on the Java course in Project Stem, so they can learn the basic syntax, which is the only thing they need since I will be doing the main coding.</div>
	<div class="essay">The fifth and final bias, which is also the most difficult one to overcome is towards myself, and it is my fear of not being good enough to lead the team and create a profitable and successful project in time. This has bothered me for a while because in the past, I have rarely been in leadership positions and this project is a first for me. In order to get the better of this issue, I will have more faith in myself and my ability to lead a team, and I will build a good relationship with every person in the team, by doing team-building exercises and etc. I will also be a good communicator because miscommunication has been the downfall of too many projects.</div>
	<div class="essay">In conclusion, I have developed a successful and foolproof way to deal with all 5 of these biases, and I sincerely hope that my team and I will have a successful ISP with minimal fallacies.</div>
